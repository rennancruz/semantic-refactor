# Bootcamp 2024 Semantic Refactor Repo

## About this repo

In this repository, I have worked towards becoming familiar with HTML and CSS. I've worked in the structure of the HTML page, as well as going in depth with the semantic tags used to build it. I have worked in refactoring a web page design to use the proper semantic tags, as well as refactoring the CSS design in the web page. Below, you can find the Horiseon marketing page I have refactored:
