# Bootcamp 2024 Semantic Refactor Repo

## About this repo

In this repository, I have worked towards becoming familiar with HTML and CSS. I've worked on the structure of the HTML page, as well as going in-depth with the semantic tags used to build it. I have worked on refactoring a web page design to use the proper semantic tags and refactoring the CSS design in the web page. Below, you can find the Horiseon marketing page I have refactored:
