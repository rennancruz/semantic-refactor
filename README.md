# Bootcamp 2024 Semantic Refactor Repo

## About this repo

In this repository, you will find all of the work made towards the semantic refactor learnings. I've include the files that have been completed as part of this work below:

- [Challenge 1](/Develop/index.html)

Along with this work, I'm working with a personal project as I go. This is to help me practice on the side as well!

- [Personal Portfolio Project](/student-portfolio/index-portfolio.html)
